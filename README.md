# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-in-Python
A Python game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against a computer opponent. You can play as many games as you like. Ideal for learning the fundamentals of Python game creation. Make use of code as a starting point for your own video game ideas.

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. The game allows a player to compete against a computer opponent in a best-of-3 match. The player inputs their choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors", and the computer generates a random choice. The winner is determined based on the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

The code is easy to follow and the game can be played in the terminal. It's a great project for beginners to learn the basics of Python programming and game development. Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own game development projects.
